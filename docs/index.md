## Hello!

I'm a recent graduate of the University of Washington (UW), where I received my masters degree in computer science and engineering. Previously, I received my bachelors degree in computer science and applied mathematics with College Honors, also at UW.

I'm broadly interested in applied machine learning, reasoning in AI, and engineering. I'm currently a machine learning engineer at [TrueMedia.org](https://www.truemedia.org) where I'm tackling deepfake detection as a continuation of [research]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link research.md %}) I conducted at UW. Starting this fall, I'll be a software engineer at Microsoft working on datacenter operations. Away from my computer, I enjoy running, reading, cooking, and dabbling in the various art forms.

- was a TA for CSE 599N (Machine Learning for Neuroscience)
- was a TA for CSE 446/546 (Machine Learning) at UW for 5 quarters, serving as head TA for 4 quarters
- received an Honorable Mention for the [Bob Bandes Memorial Award](https://www.cs.washington.edu/students/ta/bandes) for Excellence in Teaching

This site (attempts to) organize my notes, updates, and miscellaneous digital artifacts. It is very much a work in progress!
